## Faq

### **Why Fust does not restart the closed apps?**

That's because Fust won't restart apps that are not closed by it. Your app will stay closed to avoid accidentally restarting unnecessary apps.

### **How to get the name of a process?**

First, right click the taskbar and select taskmanager. Then right click the process you want to learn about and choose properties. The letters before '.exe' are the name. Put them into the textbox in the middle of the main window of Fust.

### **Why my computer does not speed up?**

Fust have to scan the processes every 1 second to make sure the processes are managed properly. If the processes you want to close are just using little resources, or your computer is good enough, you may not feel the difference. Of course, you can also use Fust to do other things, such as closing the file sync while editing your file.

### **There are some bugs or language issues! What should I do?**

Please add Issue on github. When reporting bugs, please add os version and Fust version. You can see it by right clicking Fust.exe and clicking properties. If you want to fix it, please create a pull request.
